### CW1.c 
#### Replace With Alphabet Position (6 kyu)
Programming Language: C

Welcome. In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet. If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it. "a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc. Example: alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.") Should return "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" ( as a string )

### CW2.py
#### This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:

accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"; accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"; accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z.
